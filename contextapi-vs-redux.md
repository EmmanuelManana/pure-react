Have you heard about React 16.3's Context API? It's a new(ish) feature that lets you pass props down multiple levels transparently -- similar to what Redux lets you do with connect().



Some people have called Context a "Redux killer." But is it really? And which one should you use?



Today's post walks through how to transform an app from using plain React props into one that uses Context - and another version that uses Redux - so you can see how they differ. We'll also see how to pull out the Context code into its own component so it doesn't clutter up your components.



I put together a quick video lesson on Context as well, over at Egghead.io (free for everyone to watch right now!), so check that out if video is your thing. It's short (only 3:43) and covers the essentials.
